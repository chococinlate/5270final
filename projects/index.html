        <p><em>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe with AI Models (Python)</em><br>
• Software engineered a dynamic Ultimate Tic Tac Toe with multiple artificial intelligence opponents.<br>
• Implemented machine learning algorithms and enabled game simulations between multiple AI models.<br>
• Successfully trained and evaluated AI models to achieve a maximum of 72% winning rate.<br>
<br>
<em>Gender Disparities in Corporations (Python)</em><br>
• Software engineered a simulation model studying the gender ratio of employees in each level after certain number of years.<br>
• Developed with poison process and Markov chain to simulate promotions and leavings of employees at each timestamp.<br>
• Successfully simulated the complex system and determined the effect of gender bias among various initial states and parameters.<br>
<br>
<em>Chiller System Data Science Research (Python)</em><br>
• Conducted research on inferring health state of the chiller system based on data provided by Johnson Controls.<br>
• Successfully estimated the COP as a proxy of its health using CUSUM method, Gordon Ng Model, and clustering analysis.<br>
• Coded COP’s linear regression model and summary using Python’s Matplotlib library.<br>
• Detected faults of the chiller based on the analysis and provided suggestions to improvements.<br>
<br>
<em>Feature Detection and Matching (Python)</em> <br>
• Software engineered a feature detection program that takes in two images as input, displayed in a graphic user interface.<br>
• Implemented MOPS feature descriptor and SSD feature matcher using SciPy, NumPy, and OpenCV.<br>
• Successfully identified and matched best matching discriminating features in two images.</p>
